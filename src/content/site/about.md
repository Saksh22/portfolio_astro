headline: "Hey! 👋 I'm a software engineer who focuses on building scalable web
  platforms. I work across (but not limited to) the stack - React on the
  frontend, Node/Go/Python on the backend, and cloud-native infrastructure
  underneath. My experience spans SaaS systems, micro-frontends, real-time data
  pipelines, and secure, high-availability architectures used on a large scale.
  I am also enthusiastic about cloud and DevOps technologies. "
